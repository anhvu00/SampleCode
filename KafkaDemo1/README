Goal:
Test kubernetes horizontal scaling (i.e. increase replicas when a condition is met).
Requirements:
- kubernetes
- kafka/zookeeper
- prometheus (to export metrics so kubernetes HPA can scale)
Test set up:
1. kafka/zookeeper
https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart
- Install, run zookeeper, kafka server, all default settings.
- Use command line to create "anh-topic" and add/produce some messages to it
- Use command line to consume messages from "anh-topic"
2. Springboot maven java 17 applications (mvn spring-boot:run)
- Create a Producer to add messages to "anh-topic" every second for 2 minutes
- Create a Consumer to read messages from "anh-topic" every 3 seconds
The idea is producing faster than consuming to create a "lag" which will trigger the scaling.
The project kafkaProducer and kafkaConsumer demonstrate this behavior.

TODO:
- Calculate a "lag" in the consumer
- Use Prometheus to expose this "lag" metrics to kubernetes HPA
