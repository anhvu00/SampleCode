PURPOSE:

Simple Springboot REST API (without thymeleaf to serve html pages) with endpoints returning String.
It is used to test x509 certificate/SSL connectivity between Client/Server

SETUP:

- Use Spring Initializer to create project (java 11, springboot 2.6.6)
- Create @RestController SimpleController with 1 endpoint /hello
- Create self signed certs, put them in resources folder
- Add them to application.properties (you can still access localhost:8443/hello but it is not secured)
- Add springboot-starter-security to pom.xml (accessing the above url requires a login Admin/admin)
- Add SecurityConfig.java
- Add clientBob.crt, clientBob.key and rootCA.crt
- curl "https://localhost:8443/hello" --cert clientBob.crt --key clientBob.key --cacert rootCA.crt
