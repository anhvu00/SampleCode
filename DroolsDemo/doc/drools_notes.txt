KIE = Knowledge Is Everything. Created by JBOSS
https://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/6.2.0.CR3/drools-docs/html/KIEChapter.html
Uberfire = the base Work Bench (WB) similar to Eclipse IDE providing plug-ins, a console tool.
Guvnor (version 6+) is under Uberfire.
WBs = Drools-WB, KIE-WB. Each consists of different components and purposes.

Life cycles:
1. Author: Authoring of knowledge using a UI metaphor, such as: DRL, BPMN2, decision table, class models
2. Build: Builds the authored knowledge into deployable units. (ex. KIE creates JAR files)
3. Deploy: KIE uses Maven style repository
4. Utilize: by 2 different ways
- Application loads JAR to KieSession
- KIE exposes the JAR at runtime via a KieContainer which creates KieSessions.
5. Run: Systems interact with the KieSession, via API.
