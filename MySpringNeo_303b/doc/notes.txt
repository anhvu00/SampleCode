MySpringNeo_303b
Springboot + OGM 2 + http driver

Quick start:
- Run neo4j v3.0.3 server
- Create a blank database
- Download, build, run MainApp

Notes:
See pom.xml for libraries and their versions
Database login is in /resources/ogm.properties. It's easier than before.
MainApp: the main engine is the @Component implements CommandLineRunner interface
Person: need @NodeEntity(label="PERSON") or it will use the class name ("Person") as label.
